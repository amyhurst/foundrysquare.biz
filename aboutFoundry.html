Foundry Square</big></big></big>
<p class="msonormal" style="font-family: helvetica;">
Foundry Square is located in Downtown Redding, California. <br> <br>

Built in 1938 as an automotive service center, the building was remodeled and
converted to a shopping center in 1975, the integrity of the original brick
structure being largely retained.  Today it houses an assortment of retail and
professional businesses.<br> <br>

 

Named Foundry Square because of its proximity to Gerlinger's Foundry, the Square
is often cited as a successful example of historic restoration and downtown
revitalization.<br>
